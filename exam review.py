computing concepts
   *languages
       *structures
           *loops, functions, etc.
computing implementation (in python)
problem-solving via decomposition
    *identify
       *what you know (input -- parameters)
       *what you want (output -- return value)
       *the steps to get from input to output (algorithm)

algorithmic approaches
    *imperative programming
        *variable assignment
        *iterations
    *functional programing
        *recursion
        *list comprehension, generators
    *object-oriented programing
        *objects 
        *attributes
        *methods
        
variables
    *basic types
         *int
         *float
         *string
         *boolean
    *compound
         *list
         *tuples
         *dictionaries

iterations
    *for loops (determinate)
    *while loops (indeterminate)

functions
    *aka routines, programs, procedures,scripts, methods
    *composition (f(g(H(X))))
    *some return meaningful value (pure/fruitful)
    *some, not (used for side-effects) (non-pure/crap)
  
recursion
    *f(f(x))
    *f(g(x)) and g(f(x))
    *base case and recursive case
    *related to mathematical induction
    *towers of hanoi, crossword...

generators
    *List comprehension
        *f(n):
           return [i for i in range (n+1) if i % 2 == 0]
           [object,for,condition]
    *Generators
    *Filters

objects
    *attributes (self variables)
    *methods (__init__)

decisions
    *if, else, elif
    *logical tests ==, <=, >=, !=, ...

conceptual tools
    *to help express our thoughts
       *function-driven programming
       *data-driven programming
           *poems

fundamental algorithms
    *linear search
    *binary search
    *simple sort
